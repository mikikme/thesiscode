# Balanced-m-a-l-imgdataset

This repo contains our main code and also our file feletion code, so that you are able to see how I performed data balancing operations on the dataset.

The output of text files is the deletion of the Allaple(A/L) images that were deleted for our Balanced Dataset that is found as a [Private Datasource] in Kaggle
